Here, you will learn how to feed the state vectors and 1-char target sequence to the decoder to produce predictions for the next character. I recommend you to try this approach in the weather time-series dataset =)\n",

        "* Checkout this [excellent post](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-lstm-models-for-multi-step-time-series-forecasting-of-household-power-consumption/) where Seq2Seq models are used for time-series forecasting of household power consumption. \n",

        "  There, you will not only use LSTM encoders/decorders, but also combine one-dimensional CNN with LSTMs. In the latter case, the CNN is used as an encoder to learn features from sub-sequences of input data which are provided as time steps to a decoding LSTM. This architecture is called a [CNN-LSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4389).\n",
        "\n",
        "  We can go even further and use the CNN in combination with the LSTM as our encoder. This approach is called [ConvLSTM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214v1) and is expected to capture better spatiotemporal correlations. \n",

        "* An important improvement to RNNs is the use of the [Attention mechanism](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/06/24/attention-attention.html), that helps memorizing long source sentences. Attention models are not extensively covered in the master (a couple of hours at the very end of the DL module), so that's the kind of material you could explore in your Master's Thesis ;) The cenit of the attention mechanisms is the so called [*self-attention*](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf), which has given rise to the Transformer arquitecture. Based upon it, OpenAI has been capable of generating text of [very high quality](https://talktotransformer.com/)!\n",

        "* In the 2nd module, you will see how to apply these networks to NLP problems. Meanwhile, you might want to read about [image captioning](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/image_captioning), [neural translation with attention](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/nmt_with_attention), [text generation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/text/text_generation) or [question-answer generation]()\n"
