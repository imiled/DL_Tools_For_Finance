# TFM Introduction Deep Learning Tools For Finance 
## Application to Transfert Learning for Technical analysis

This project contains the deep learning tools putting in practice to financial area:
There is a notebook FinanceData_ML_Clean.ipynb which is my personal ongoing walkthrough for Deep learning application in Finance.
The notebook is not complete so far like RL and some part need more fine tunning as the training of the models or optimisation of the code. But the objective of this workbook is to use it as a reference methodology for more specific studies and update it when one of the specific problem is completed. 

At the same time for this TFM, I focused  on applying CNN Transfert learning to an image of the sp500 technical graph image. The objective is to get a complete dataset a trained model based on vgg16 infrastucture, the model evaluation and last point for any image of a stock evolution we have a tool that tell us if we would rather  buy or sell.
I consider here a problem of behaviour finance as most investor look throughly at those graph more than fondamental numbers and those graph can be interpretated on small horizon (minutes) or long (years) to get an estimation of its evolution. The humain will process this information deeply and the consequence of this process is the behaviour of stock market. Benjamin Graham in the "Intelligent Investor" - written in 1949 and considered as the bible of value investing - introduce the allegory of Mr. Market, meant to personify the irrationality and group-think of the stock market. As of august 2020, the value of some stocks are higher than the economy of France and Germany and small company (Tesla) are bought at a price quite difficult to apprehend in terms of valuation fondamental and comparison to established company in Europe (Volkswagen). That is true, that our brain is set to always find an explanation but in this approach we' ll try to apprehend the impact of price evolution to make Mr Market more greedy or fearful.

In this project I have chosen to present 5 steps which can be taken separately as we can load save datas or models. 

I worked on it in google colab you can see it in the following file :



But it can be launched in local also using the command to get the specific packages :

pip install requirement.txt

or using this Docker command to get the appropiate environment:

xxxx

Now for each step can be taken independently as we are saving loading datas and model at each time.

## Generate Dataset of the Image and the Future maket state
execute: python3 step1_generate_dataset_IndexImage.py

In this part we are generating the training and testing dataset.
First we download the historical prices of the sp500 from 1927 to 31 July 2020 and built the image of 15 days historical graph also we get the 5 days future price evolution of the sp500. 
From the future price evolution, we calculate a future state which can be splitted in 6 classes :

Sell-Sell | Sell- Neutral | Neutral | Neutral -Buy | Buy -Buy (and the Error class)

The objective is to get the following files which represent a dataframe in the data/ repertory:

X_train_image.csv , X_test_image.csv a 3072 column time serie dataframe  of the image (32 x 32 x3) of the sp500 closing price 

Y_test_StateClass.csv, Y_train_StateClass.csv a 1 column time serie dataframe of the future state value betwwen -1 to 4

We generate also the following files but we wonÂ´t use it in this project - more fore RNN & price prediction - Y_test_FutPredict.csv Y_train_FutPredict.csv

the testing and training time serie dataset are shuffled by the date of reference with a split number of 0.8

Please note that: 
1. We can increase the dataset taking into account the evolution very liquid stocks or other indices as long as we have very high the liquidity and number of participants 
2. The calculation of the dataset can take more than 6 hours of calulation as the code is not optimized so far, we can quickly implement parallel computing and rapid image setup instead of going through for this task an

## Loading training datas
execute: python3 step2_loadingtrainingdatas.py 
This part is for loading the training dataset as it is better to generate it once for all in step 1 because of it time consuming process.

This part also configure back the X_train datas from dataframe based on columns to a (32,32,3) np. array for the input of the model 

## Build up of the VGGsp500 model and train
execute: python3 step3_vgg_transfert_modelandtraining.py
In this part we suppose that we have the training dataset taken from step 2.
We use a Transfert model for vgg16 and some other layers.
we use for this example a categorical_crossentropy loss and rmsprop optimizer.
This part can be fined tuned for each financial index or stock index (layers, optimmizer, metrics, dropout) but in this case we introduced a simplier case.
We train and save the model, please refer to XX to see the convergence of the model.

We have 14.7M parameters and 66k trainable parametres. the size of training input is 571M only for the image not including rolling volatility, moving average etc

## Evaluate the VGGsp500
execute: python3 step4_evaluate_vggsp500_model.py
This part will evaluate the model with the testing dataset that we generated in first step.
We show the accuracy, the confusion matrix and the classification report 

## Guess future market state from random image
execute: step5_guess_future_marketstate_from_image.py
Take an image of an historical graph from a market webpage like investing.com  and save it to the ImageM/ folder with name image1.PNG or you can change the value of image_path to the link you need.

This execution tell us which market state in the future is the best representative.
